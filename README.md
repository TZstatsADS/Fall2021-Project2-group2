+ **Project summary**: 
We decided to focus on the effects that COVID had on home life - specifically the effect that stay at home orders had on specific aspects of home health, including domestic violence and pet adoptions. For domestic violence, the main program we focused on was the Mayor's Office to End Domestic and Gender-BasedViolence program. The dashboard's goal is to show the effects the pandemic had on domestic violence cases, how outreach during the pandemic affected HOPE visits, and visuals of resources provided by the program. In addition, the dashboard provides pet adoptions over time during the pandemic, as adopting a pet can be a coping mechanism for issues that arose due to the pandemic.
